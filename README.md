# My Todo App

This is a very basic ToDo app built using .NET MAUI. It allows users to add tasks and check them off when completed. This project was meant to further develop my knowledge of C# as well
as learn to work with .NET MAUI.

## Features
* Add new tasks to your list.
* Mark tasks as completed.
* Simple and clean user interface.

## Prerequisites

* You need an IDE that supports .NET MAUI development (Visual Studio, JetBrains Rider, etc.).
* Git: To clone this repository, youâ€™ll need to have Git installed. You can download Git [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
